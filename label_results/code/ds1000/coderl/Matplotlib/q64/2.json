{"trg_prediction": "# I think this is not the best practice solution, but it is easy to read.\n# I just did some math on the figure and figure title. Somehow that's not what I expected.\n\n# this code is from Russia with love.\n# it is not as easy as defining a grid of points and labels, but it is easy to read.\n\n# I used grid(True) from the bottom, and grid(False) from the top. But this worked,\n# so it wasn't easy to read. So I used grid(True) and grid(False).\n\n# however, the idea is to use this approach instead of the default grid(),\n# so that the labels are aligned with the points.\n\n# I used grid(), but now it's slightly different. Here's the example:\n\n# the grid():\n# [x,y]\n# [0,5]\n# [1,2]\n# [0,10]\n# [1,2]\n# [0,10]\n\n# and the grid():\n# [x,y,z]\n# [0,5,0,0]\n# [1,2,1,2]\n# [0,10,0,0]\n# [1,2,1,2]\n\n# and the grid():\n# [x,y,z,w]\n# [0,5,0,0]\n# [1,2,1,2]\n# [0,10,0,0]\n# [1,2,1,2]\n# [0,10,0,0]\n# [1,2,1,2]\n\n# We are using x-axes, y-axes, and z-axes as the vertical coordinates\n# of the legend. The y-axis is used for the x-axes and z-axes.\n# So the x-axes coords will have different x-coords.\n# The y-axes coords will have different y-coords.\n\n# Let's look at the grid():\n\n# [x,y,z]\n# [0,5,0,0]\n# [1,2,1,2]\n# [0,10,0,0]\n# [1,2,1,2]\n# [0,10"}
