#SOLUTION START
# I couldn't figure out how to make a "second" x axis tick label faster by
# mapping the x numbers to numbers.  Say I had tried to map every
# number in the y-axis to "second".  This worked.  Still I could have
# tried to map every number in the x-axis to "second" but it didn't
# work.
# I'm sure I can find a way that would work without trying to map every
# number in the y-axis to "second".
# I don't think this works because there is a "second" x-axis
# tick label for every x-axis number.

#I don't think I could have mapped every x-axis number to "second"
# but I needed to map every x-axis number to "second"
# I could also have tried mapping every x-axis number to "second"
# or just "second"
# I would have written a loop to find the last x-axis number
#we'll start by looking at the last x-axis number and mapping it.
#So that would be the best I can do.  The loop will continue to
# search for the last x-axis number, and if found, it'll return it.


#This worked...  Now I got the time to map every number in the
# x-axis to "second".  What's the point that?  I realized that there
#was a "second" x-axis label for every x-axis number.  The loop
#should start with the last x-axis number and mapping it.  So if we
#seen this and found it, there was a loop.  So if it's not found
#we'll start with the last x-axis number.
