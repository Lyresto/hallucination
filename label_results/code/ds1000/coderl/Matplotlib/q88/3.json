Say I had tried to map every\n# number in the y-axis to \"second\".  This worked.  Still I could have\n# tried to map every number in the x-axis to \"second\" but it didn't\n# work.\n# I'm sure I can find a way that would work without trying to map every\n# number in the y-axis to \"second\".\n# I don't think this works because there is a \"second\" x-axis\n# tick label for every x-axis number.\n\n#I don't think I could have mapped every x-axis number to \"second\"\n# but I needed to map every x-axis number to \"second\"\n# I could also have tried mapping every x-axis number to \"second\"\n# or just \"second\"\n# I would have written a loop to find the last x-axis number\n#we'll start by looking at the last x-axis number and mapping it.\n#So that would be the best I can do.  The loop will continue to\n# search for the last x-axis number, and if found, it'll return it.\n\n\n#This worked...  Now I got the time to map every number in the\n# x-axis to \"second\".  What's the point that?  I realized that there\n#was a \"second\" x-axis label for every x-axis number.  The loop\n#should start with the last x-axis number and mapping it.  So if we\n#seen this and found it, there was a loop.  So if it's not found\n#we'll start with the last x-axis number.\n\n#I could have made a loop that will map every x-axis number to \"second\"\n#and return it.  This worked.
