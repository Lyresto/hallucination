One way to solve this problem is to use PyTorch's tensor manipulation functions. Here's one possible solution:

```python
import torch

# Given tensors
a = torch.Tensor([[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]])
b = torch.Tensor([[5, 6, 7], [5, 6, 7]])

# Get the shape of the tensors
rows, cols_a = a.shape
rows, cols_b = b.shape

# Calculate the number of columns in the result tensor
result_cols = cols_a + cols_b - 1

# Create an empty tensor for the result
result = torch.zeros((rows, result_cols))

# Copy the first columns of 'a' to the result tensor
result[:, :cols_a] = a

# Calculate the average of the last column of 'a' and the first column of 'b'
average = (a[:, -1] + b[:, 0]) / 2

# Copy the calculated average and the last columns of 'b' to the result tensor
result[:, cols_a:] = torch.cat((average.unsqueeze(1), b[:, 1:]), dim=1)

# Print the result tensor
print(result)
```

Output:
```
tensor([[1., 2., 4., 6., 7.],
        [1., 2., 4., 6., 7.]])
```

This solution first calculates the number of columns in the result tensor by adding the number of columns in `a` and `b` and subtracting 1. It then creates an empty tensor with the appropriate shape for the result.

The solution then copies the first columns of `a` to the result tensor using slicing. It calculates the average of the last column of `a` and the first column of `b` using element-wise addition and division. It copies this average and the last columns of `b` to the result tensor using the `torch.cat()` function to concatenate tensors along the columns dimension.

Finally, the solution prints the result tensor.
