{"trg_prediction": "Here is a solution using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef Count(A, B):\n    assert A.shape == B.shape, \"Input tensors must have the same shape\"\n    \n    # Convert tensors to PyTorch tensors if they are not already\n    A = torch.tensor(A)\n    B = torch.tensor(B)\n    \n    # Count the number of equal elements\n    cnt_equal = torch.sum(A == B)\n    \n    return cnt_equal\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first assert that the input tensors have the same shape. Then, we convert the input tensors to PyTorch tensors using `torch.tensor()` if they are not already. Finally, we use the `==` operator to compare the elements of the two tensors element-wise, and then use `torch.sum()` to count the number of equal elements."}
