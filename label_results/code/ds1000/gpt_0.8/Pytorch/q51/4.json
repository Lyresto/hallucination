{"trg_prediction": "One way to solve this problem is to use the `torch.eq` function to compare the two tensors element-wise, and then use the `torch.sum` function to count the number of equal elements.\n\nHere's one possible solution:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef Count(A, B):\n    equal_elements = torch.eq(A, B)\n    cnt_equal = torch.sum(equal_elements)\n    return cnt_equal.item()\n```\n\nIn this solution, the `torch.eq` function compares the elements of tensors `A` and `B` element-wise and returns a new tensor of the same shape where each element is `True` if the corresponding elements in `A` and `B` are equal, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe `torch.sum` function is then used to calculate the sum of all the `True` values in the `equal_elements` tensor, which gives the count of equal elements.\n\nFinally, the `.item()` method is used to extract the count as a Python scalar.\n\nYou can then call this function with your tensors `A` and `B` to get the count of equal elements:\n\n```python\ncnt_equal = Count(A, B)\nprint(cnt_equal)\n```\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the tensors `A` and `B` have the same shape, i.e., both have dimensions 1000 * 1."}
