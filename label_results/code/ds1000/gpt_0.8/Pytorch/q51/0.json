{"trg_prediction": "You can use the `torch.eq()` function to check for element-wise equality between two tensors. Then, you can use the `torch.sum()` function to count the number of elements that are equal.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef count_equal_elements(A, B):\n    # Check for element-wise equality\n    equal_elements = torch.eq(A, B)\n    \n    # Count the number of equal elements\n    count = torch.sum(equal_elements).item()\n    \n    return count\n```\n\nIn this example, `A` and `B` are the input tensors of dimension 1000 * 1. The `torch.eq()` function returns a tensor of the same shape as the input tensors, where each element is `True` if the corresponding elements in `A` and `B` are equal, and `False` otherwise. Then, the `torch.sum()` function is used to sum all the `True` values in the `equal_elements` tensor, and the `.item()` method is used to convert the resulting tensor to a Python integer.\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```python\nA, B = load_data()  # Load your tensors here\ncnt_equal = count_equal_elements(A, B)\nprint(\"Number of equal elements:\", cnt_equal)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace the `load_data()` function with the appropriate code to load your tensors."}
