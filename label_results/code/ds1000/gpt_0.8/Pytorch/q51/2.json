{"trg_prediction": "Here's one way to solve the problem using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef count_equal_elements(A, B):\n    # Convert A and B to PyTorch tensors if they are not already\n    if not isinstance(A, torch.Tensor):\n        A = torch.tensor(A)\n    if not isinstance(B, torch.Tensor):\n        B = torch.tensor(B)\n    \n    # Ensure that A and B have the same shape\n    assert A.shape == B.shape, \"A and B must have the same shape\"\n    \n    # Count the number of equal elements\n    cnt_equal = torch.sum(A == B)\n    \n    return cnt_equal\n```\n\nYou can use this function as follows:\n\n```python\nA, B = load_data()\ncnt_equal = count_equal_elements(A, B)\nprint(cnt_equal)\n```\n\nNote that this function assumes that `A` and `B` are either PyTorch tensors or arrays that can be converted to tensors. If they are not, you may need to modify the code accordingly."}
