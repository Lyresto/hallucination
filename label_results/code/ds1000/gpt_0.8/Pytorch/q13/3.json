{"trg_prediction": "To slice a PyTorch tensor using a logical index on the columns, you can use the `torch.masked_select()` function. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired result:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\nC = torch.LongTensor([[1, 3], [4, 6]])\n# 1 3\n# 4 6\n\nA_log = torch.ByteTensor([1, 0, 1]) # the logical index\nB = torch.LongTensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n\n# Create a mask tensor from the logical index\nmask = A_log.unsqueeze(0).expand(B.size())\n\n# Use masked_select to select the columns based on the mask\nC = torch.masked_select(B, mask)\n\n# Reshape the result to match the desired output shape\nC = C.view(B.size(0), -1)\n\nprint(C)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\ntensor([[1, 3],\n        [4, 6]])\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first create a mask tensor by expanding the logical index `A_log` to match the size of tensor `B`. Then, we use `torch.masked_select()` to select the elements from `B` based on the mask. Finally, we reshape the result to match the desired output shape.\n\nNote that the `unsqueeze(0)` and `view()` operations are used to manipulate the dimensions of the tensors to ensure they can be broadcasted correctly."}
