{"trg_prediction": "Here's one way to perform matrix by matrix multiplication using a sparse CSR matrix in scipy:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy import sparse\n\nm = sparse.csr_matrix([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\nc = sparse.csr_matrix([[0,1,2]])\n\nresult = m.multiply(c)\n```\n\nThe `multiply()` method is used to perform element-wise multiplication between the two matrices. The result will also be a sparse CSR matrix.\n\nNote that in this example, `c` is a 2D matrix with shape (1,3) instead of a 1D array. This is because sparse matrix operations in scipy typically expect 2D matrices."}
