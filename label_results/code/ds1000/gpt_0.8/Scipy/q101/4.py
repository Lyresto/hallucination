To estimate the parameters of the multinomial distribution using maximum likelihood estimation, you can follow these steps:

1. Count the number of occurrences of each category in your data frame `a`.
2. Calculate the total number of observations in your data frame `a`.
3. Define the log-likelihood function for the multinomial distribution.
4. Use a numerical optimization algorithm to maximize the log-likelihood function and find the best estimates for the probabilities of each category.

Here's an example implementation:

```python
import scipy.optimize as sciopt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

a = pd.DataFrame({'A1': [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 6, 0, 1, 1, 7, 10]})

# Step 1: Count the number of occurrences of each category
counts = a['A1'].value_counts().sort_index()

# Step 2: Calculate the total number of observations
total_observations = counts.sum()

# Step 3: Define the log-likelihood function for the multinomial distribution
def multinomial_log_likelihood(probabilities):
    log_likelihood = 0
    for i, count in enumerate(counts):
        log_likelihood += count * np.log(probabilities[i])
    return -log_likelihood

# Step 4: Use numerical optimization to find the best estimates for the probabilities
initial_guess = np.ones(len(counts)) / len(counts)
result = sciopt.minimize(multinomial_log_likelihood, initial_guess, method='Nelder-Mead')

# Extract the best estimates for the probabilities
best_probabilities = result.x

# Print the estimated probabilities
for i, probability in enumerate(best_probabilities):
    print(f'Category {i}: {probability:.3f}')
```

This code will output the estimated probabilities for each category based on your data frame `a`. The optimization algorithm used in this example is the Nelder-Mead method, which is a commonly used algorithm for general optimization problems. You can try different optimization methods provided by `scipy.optimize.minimize` to see if you get consistent results.
