First, let's define the likelihood function for the multinomial distribution. The likelihood function is the probability of observing the given data under a certain set of parameters. In this case, the parameters are the probabilities for each category.

We can calculate the likelihood by using the probability mass function (PMF) of the multinomial distribution. The PMF is given by:

P(X = x) = (n!/x1!x2!...xk!) * (p1^x1) * (p2^x2) * ... * (pk^xk)

where:
- X is the random variable representing the category
- x is the observed frequency for each category
- n is the total number of observations
- k is the number of categories
- p1, p2, ..., pk are the probabilities for each category

To simplify the calculation, we can take the logarithm of the likelihood function, which is called the log-likelihood:

logLikelihood = log(P(X = x)) = log(n!) - (log(x1!) + log(x2!) + ... + log(xk!)) + (x1 * log(p1) + x2 * log(p2) + ... + xk * log(pk))

To find the best parameters, we can maximize the log-likelihood function using numerical optimization methods. In this case, we can use the scipy.optimize.minimize function.

Here's the code to find the best parameters using maximum likelihood estimation:

<code>
import scipy.optimize as sciopt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Define the log-likelihood function
def log_likelihood(params, x):
    # Extract the probabilities from the parameters
    p = params[:len(x)]
    p = p / np.sum(p)  # Ensure probabilities sum to 1

    # Calculate the log-likelihood
    log_likelihood = np.sum(x * np.log(p))
    log_likelihood -= np.sum(np.log(np.math.factorial(x)))

    return -log_likelihood  # Minimize the negative log-likelihood

# Initialize the parameters with equal probabilities for each category
params_init = np.ones(len(a)) / len(a)

# Define the constraints: probabilities must be between 0 and 1, and sum to 1
constraints = ({'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda p: 1 - np.sum(p)},
               {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda p: p},
               {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda p: 1 - p})

# Define the bounds: probabilities must be between 0 and 1
bounds = [(0, 1)] * len(a)

# Find the best parameters using maximum likelihood estimation
result = sciopt.minimize(log_likelihood, params_init, args=(a['A1'],), method='SLSQP', bounds=bounds, constraints=constraints)

# Extract the best parameters
weights = result.x / np.sum(result.x)
