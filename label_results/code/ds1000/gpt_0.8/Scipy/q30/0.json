{"trg_prediction": "One way to make a sparse scipy matrix symmetric is to iterate over the non-zero elements of the matrix and set the corresponding element in the transposed position. \n\nHere's one possible solution using the `lil_matrix` format:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.sparse import lil_matrix\n\ndef make_symmetric(matrix):\n    num_rows, num_cols = matrix.shape\n    for i in range(num_rows):\n        for j in matrix.rows[i]:\n            if j != i:\n                matrix[j, i] = matrix[i, j]\n    return matrix\n\n# Example usage\nM = lil_matrix((10, 10))\n# Populate M with some non-zero values\n\nM = make_symmetric(M)\n```\n\nThis solution iterates over the rows of the matrix and for each non-zero element, it checks if the corresponding element in the transposed position exists. If it doesn't, it sets it to the same value.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the matrix is already in the `lil_matrix` format. If you have a different sparse matrix format, you can convert it to `lil_matrix` using the `toarray()` or `tolil()` methods before using the `make_symmetric()` function."}
