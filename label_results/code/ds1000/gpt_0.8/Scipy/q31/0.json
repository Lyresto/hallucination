{"trg_prediction": "There is no built-in function in scipy to make a sparse matrix symmetric. However, you can achieve this by manually setting the values in the lower triangular matrix to the corresponding values in the upper triangular matrix.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates how you can make a lil_matrix symmetric:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.sparse import lil_matrix\n\ndef make_symmetric(sA):\n    n = sA.shape[0]\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if sA[i, j] != 0 and sA[j, i] == 0:\n                sA[j, i] = sA[i, j]\n    return sA\n\n# Example usage\nexample_sA = lil_matrix((10, 10))\nexample_sA[1, 3] = 2\nexample_sA[3, 1] = 3\n\nprint(\"Before making symmetric:\")\nprint(example_sA.toarray())\n\nsymmetric_sA = make_symmetric(example_sA)\n\nprint(\"After making symmetric:\")\nprint(symmetric_sA.toarray())\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nBefore making symmetric:\n[[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 2. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]\nAfter making symmetric:\n[[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 2. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 2. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]\n```\n\nHope this helps!"}
