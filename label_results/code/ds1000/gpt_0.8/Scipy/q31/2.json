{"trg_prediction": "To make a sparse scipy matrix symmetric, you can iterate over the non-zero elements of the matrix and set the corresponding element at [col, row] to be equal to the element at [row, col]. Here's an example implementation for a lil_matrix:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.sparse import lil_matrix\n\ndef make_symmetric(sA):\n    for row in range(sA.shape[0]):\n        for col in range(sA.shape[1]):\n            if sA[row, col] != 0 and sA[col, row] == 0:\n                sA[col, row] = sA[row, col]\n    return sA\n```\n\nYou can use this function to make your lil_matrix symmetric:\n\n```python\nsA = lil_matrix((10, 10))\n# populate sA\nsA = make_symmetric(sA)\n```\n\nNote that this implementation assumes that the matrix is square and that the diagonal elements (sA[i, i]) are always present. If your matrix is not square or does not have diagonal elements, you may need to modify the implementation accordingly."}
