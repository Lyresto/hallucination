{"trg_prediction": "To count the number of regions of cells that exceed a given threshold, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import ndimage\n\ndef count_regions(img, threshold):\n    # Create a binary mask of cells that exceed the threshold\n    mask = img > threshold\n    \n    # Label connected regions in the mask\n    labels, num_regions = ndimage.label(mask)\n    \n    return num_regions\n\n# Example usage\nnum_regions = count_regions(img, 0.75)\nprint(\"Number of regions:\", num_regions)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `ndimage.label` function from the `scipy` library to label connected regions in the binary mask. The `count_regions` function takes as input the image array and the threshold value, and returns the number of regions that exceed the threshold."}
