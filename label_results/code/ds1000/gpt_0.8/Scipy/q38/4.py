To calculate pairwise Euclidean distances between all regions in the given raster patch, you can use the `cdist` function from `scipy.spatial.distance` module. Here's the solution to obtain the minimum distance separating the nearest edges of each raster patch:

```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.spatial.distance

example_array = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 6, 0, 3, 3, 3],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3],
                          [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3],
                          [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3],
                          [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],
                          [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],
                          [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                          [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0],
                          [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]])

# Get unique IDs from the raster patches
unique_ids = np.unique(example_array)

# Get the coordinates of the patch centers
centers = []
for unique_id in unique_ids:
    indices = np.argwhere(example_array == unique_id)
    center = np.mean(indices, axis=0)
    centers.append(center)

# Calculate pairwise Euclidean distances between patch centers
distances = scipy.spatial.distance.cdist(centers, centers, metric='euclidean')

# Get the minimum distance between patches excluding the distance to itself
min_distances = np.min(distances[np.nonzero(distances)])

print(min_distances)
```

This will give you the minimum distance separating the nearest edges of each raster patch. You can multiply this distance by the raster resolution to get the distance in meters.
