{"trg_prediction": "To calculate the pairwise Euclidean distances between all regions in the raster, you can use the `cdist` function from the `scipy.spatial.distance` module. However, since `cdist` expects a 1D array as input, you will need to reshape your 2D array into a 1D array. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import cdist\n\n# Reshape the 2D array into a 1D array\nreshaped_array = example_array.reshape(-1)\n\n# Calculate the pairwise Euclidean distances using cdist\ndistances = cdist(np.argwhere(reshaped_array > 0), np.argwhere(reshaped_array > 0))\n\n# Convert the distances from cells to meters by multiplying with the raster resolution\n# Assuming the raster resolution is 1 (change this value accordingly)\ndistances *= 1\n\n# Convert the distances to a N*N array in the form of \"from ID, to ID, distance\"\nn = reshaped_array.max()  # Number of unique IDs\nresult = np.zeros((n, n, 3))\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        result[i, j, 0] = i + 1  # From ID\n        result[i, j, 1] = j + 1  # To ID\n        result[i, j, 2] = distances[i, j]  # Distance\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will give you a N*N array `result` containing the minimum distances separating the nearest edges of each raster patch, in the form of \"from ID, to ID, distance\"."}
