The dimensions of matrix A and matrix B are not compatible for element-wise multiplication. In order to perform the desired operation, we need to reshape matrix B to be compatible with matrix A. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.random.rand(5, 6, 3)
B = np.random.rand(3, 3)

# Reshape B to match the dimensions of A
B_reshaped = B.reshape(1, 1, 3, 3)

# Perform element-wise multiplication
result = A * B_reshaped

# Print the shape of the resulting matrix
print(result.shape)
```

The resulting matrix will have the shape (5, 6, 3), which is the desired shape.
