{"trg_prediction": "To multiply the values of matrix A along the third dimension with matrix B, you can use the `np.matmul()` function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nA = np.random.rand(5, 6, 3)\nB = np.random.rand(3, 3)\n\nresult = np.matmul(A, B)\n\nprint(result.shape)  # shape will be (5, 6, 3)\n```\n\nThis will give you a matrix of shape (x, y, 3) where the values of the third dimension of A are multiplied by matrix B."}
