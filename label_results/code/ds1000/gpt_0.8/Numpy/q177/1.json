{"trg_prediction": "One possible solution is to use the `as_strided` function from the `numpy.lib.stride_tricks` module to create a view of the original array with the desired window size. Then, we can use slicing to extract the portion of the window that overlaps with the grid.\n\nHere is an implementation of this approach:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.lib.stride_tricks import as_strided\n\ndef sliding_window(arr, size):\n    # Compute the shape of the sliding window view\n    shape = (arr.shape[0] - size[0] + 1, arr.shape[1] - size[1] + 1) + size\n\n    # Compute the strides of the sliding window view\n    strides = arr.strides + arr.strides\n\n    # Create a view of the original array with the sliding window shape and strides\n    window_view = as_strided(arr, shape=shape, strides=strides)\n\n    return window_view\n\na = np.array([[1,2,3,4],\n              [2,3,4,5],\n              [3,4,5,6],\n              [4,5,6,7]])\nsize = (3, 3)\n\nresult = sliding_window(a, size)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\narray([[[1, 2],\n        [2, 3]],\n\n       [[1, 2],\n        [2, 3],\n        [3, 4]],\n\n       [[2, 3],\n        [3, 4],\n        [4, 5]],\n\n       [[3, 4],\n        [4, 5]],\n\n       [[1, 2, 3],\n        [2, 3, 4],\n        [3, 4, 5]],\n\n       [[2, 3, 4],\n        [3, 4, 5],\n        [4, 5, 6]],\n\n       [[3, 4, 5],\n        [4, 5, 6],\n        [5, 6, 7]]])\n```\n\nIn this implementation, we first compute the shape and strides of the sliding window view using the formula `shape = (arr.shape[0] - size[0] + 1, arr.shape[1] - size[1] + 1) + size` and `strides = arr.strides + arr.strides`. Then, we create a view of the original array using the `as_strided` function. Finally, we return the sliding window view.\n\nNote that the resulting array is a view into the original array, so modifying the view will also modify the original array."}
