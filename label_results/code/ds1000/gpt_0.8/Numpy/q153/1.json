{"trg_prediction": "One way to solve this problem without using a for loop is by using the `np.isin` function from NumPy. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nA = np.array([1,1,2,3,3,3,4,5,6,7,8,8])\nB = np.array([1,4,8])\n\n# Find the indices of elements in A that are also in B\nindices = np.where(np.isin(A, B))\n\n# Use the indices to select the corresponding elements from A\nC = A[indices]\n\nprint(C)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\narray([2, 3, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7])\n```\n\nThe `np.isin` function returns a boolean array that indicates whether each element in A is present in B. The `np.where` function returns the indices where the condition is True. Finally, we use these indices to select the corresponding elements from A and assign them to C."}
