{"trg_prediction": "One way to extract the patches is to use the `as_strided` function from the `numpy.lib.stride_tricks` module. Here's the code to achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.lib.stride_tricks import as_strided\n\na = np.array([[1,5,9,13],\n              [2,6,10,14],\n              [3,7,11,15],\n              [4,8,12,16]])\n\npatch_size = (2, 2)\nstride = a.itemsize * np.array(a.shape)\n\npatches = as_strided(a, shape=(a.shape[0] - patch_size[0] + 1, a.shape[1] - patch_size[1] + 1) + patch_size, strides=stride)\n\nresult = patches.reshape((-1,) + patch_size)\n```\n\nThe `patch_size` variable represents the size of each patch, and `stride` calculates the appropriate strides for the patches.\n\nThe `as_strided` function returns a view of the original array with the desired patches. Reshaping the result to `-1` ensures that the patches are flattened into a 3D array.\n\nThe resulting `result` variable will contain the desired patches."}
