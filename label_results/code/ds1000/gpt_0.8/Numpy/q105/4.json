{"trg_prediction": "To generate a log uniform distribution in Python, you can use the `numpy` library along with the `numpy.random.uniform` function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nmin_val = np.exp(0)  # min value (e.g., exp(min))\nmax_val = np.exp(1)  # max value (e.g., exp(max))\nn = 10000  # number of samples\n\nlog_uniform_samples = np.random.uniform(low=min_val, high=max_val, size=n)\n```\n\nIn the above code, `np.exp(0)` and `np.exp(1)` are used to convert the min and max values to their exponential equivalents. The `np.random.uniform` function then generates `n` samples from a uniform distribution between `min_val` and `max_val`, which effectively gives you a log uniform distribution.\n\nThe resulting `log_uniform_samples` variable will contain `n` log uniformly distributed values within the specified range.\n\nNote: Make sure to avoid using variable names like `min` and `max` as they are built-in function names in Python."}
