{"trg_prediction": "You can use the `numpy.reshape()` function to achieve this. Here's the code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([[1,5,9,13],\n              [2,6,10,14],\n              [3,7,11,15],\n              [4,8,12,16]])\n\nresult = np.reshape(a, (int(a.shape[0]/2), 2, 2))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `numpy.reshape()` function reshapes the array `a` into the specified shape.\n- We use `int(a.shape[0]/2)` to determine the number of 2x2 patches based on the number of rows in `a`.\n- The shape `(int(a.shape[0]/2), 2, 2)` specifies that the resulting array should have `int(a.shape[0]/2)` patches, each of size 2x2.\n\nNote that the resulting array `result` will be a 3-dimensional numpy array."}
