{"trg_prediction": "One way to find a maximal set of linearly independent vectors from a given matrix is by performing a rank calculation. The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in the matrix.\n\nTo find the maximal set of linearly independent vectors, we can perform the following steps:\n\n1. Transpose the matrix if necessary. In this case, the given matrix `a` is already in row echelon form, so no transposition is needed.\n\n2. Calculate the rank of the matrix using the `numpy.linalg.matrix_rank()` function.\n\n3. Select the first `rank` number of rows or columns as the maximal set of linearly independent vectors.\n\nHere is the code to perform these steps:\n\n<code>\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given matrix\na = np.array([[0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]])\n\n# Calculate the rank of the matrix\nrank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(a)\n\n# Select the first 'rank' number of rows/columns as the maximal set of linearly independent vectors\nresult = a[:rank]\n\nprint(result)\n"}
