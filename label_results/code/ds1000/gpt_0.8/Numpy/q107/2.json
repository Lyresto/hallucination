{"trg_prediction": "One way to solve this problem is by using a loop and iterating over the elements of A to compute the corresponding elements of B. Here is one possible implementation using pandas:\n\n```python\nB = pd.Series(index=A.index)\n\n# Compute B[0]\nB[0] = a * A[0]\n\n# Compute B[t] for t > 0\nfor t in range(1, len(A)):\n    B[t] = a * A[t] + b * B[t-1]\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `numpy` library to vectorize the computation and avoid the loop:\n\n```python\nB = np.zeros_like(A)\nB[0] = a * A[0]\nB[1:] = a * A[1:] + b * B[:-1]\nB = pd.Series(B, index=A.index)\n```\n\nBoth of these implementations will give you the desired series B, computed recursively according to the given formula."}
