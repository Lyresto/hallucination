{"trg_prediction": "One way to solve this problem is by using a for loop to iterate through the elements of series A and compute the corresponding values of series B. Here's an example of how you can do this using pandas:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Define series A and constants a and b\nA = pd.Series(np.random.randn(10,))\na = 2\nb = 3\n\n# Compute series B\nB = pd.Series(index=A.index)  # Create an empty series B with the same index as A\nB[0] = a * A[0]  # Compute the first element of B\n\nfor t in range(1, len(A)):\n    B[t] = a * A[t] + b * B[t-1]  # Compute the remaining elements of B using the recursive formula\n\nprint(B)\n```\n\nThis will give you a series B that satisfies the recursive formula you provided."}
