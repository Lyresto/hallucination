{"trg_prediction": "To perform a weighted two-tailed t-test, you can use the `scipy.stats.ttest_ind` function. However, as you mentioned, the two samples need to be of equal size. In order to handle this discrepancy, you can use the `nanmean` and `nanstd` functions from the `numpy` library to compute the mean and standard deviation while ignoring any NaN values in the data.\n\nHere's an example of how you can calculate the p-value:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\na = np.random.randn(40)\nb = 4 * np.random.randn(50)\n\n# Remove NaN values from the data\na = a[~np.isnan(a)]\nb = b[~np.isnan(b)]\n\n# Calculate the weighted mean and standard deviation\nmean_a = np.nanmean(a)\nmean_b = np.nanmean(b)\nstd_a = np.nanstd(a)\nstd_b = np.nanstd(b)\n\n# Calculate the sample sizes\nn_a = len(a)\nn_b = len(b)\n\n# Calculate the degrees of freedom\ndf = n_a + n_b - 2\n\n# Calculate the standard error\nse = np.sqrt(((n_a - 1) * std_a ** 2 + (n_b - 1) * std_b ** 2) / df * (1 / n_a + 1 / n_b))\n\n# Calculate the t-value\nt_value = (mean_a - mean_b) / se\n\n# Calculate the p-value\np_value = 2 * (1 - ttest_ind(a, b, equal_var=False)[1])\n\nprint(p_value)\n```\n\nThis code first removes any NaN values from the data using the `~np.isnan()` function. Then, it calculates the weighted means and standard deviations of the two samples using `np.nanmean()` and `np.nanstd()`. The sample sizes are obtained using the `len()` function, and the degrees of freedom are calculated as `n_a + n_b - 2`.\n\nThe standard error is computed based on the formula for two independent samples with unequal variances. Finally, the t-value is calculated as the difference in means divided by the standard error. The p-value is then obtained by multiplying the p-value returned by the `ttest_ind` function by 2 to get the two-tailed p-value.\n\nNote that the `equal_var=False` argument is passed to the `ttest_ind` function to indicate that the variances of the two samples are not assumed to be equal.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}
