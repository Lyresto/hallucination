{"trg_prediction": "# Solution:\nTo perform a weighted two-tailed t-test, you can use the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` module. However, as you mentioned, the two samples need to have equal sizes. To overcome this, you can use the `nanmean` and `nanstd` functions from the `numpy` module to calculate the mean and standard deviation of each sample, while ignoring any `nan` values.\n\nHere's how you can calculate the p-value for a two-tailed t-test:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\n# Generate random data for sample 1 and sample 2\na = np.random.randn(40)\nb = 4 * np.random.randn(50)\n\n# Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each sample, ignoring nans\nmean_a = np.nanmean(a)\nstd_a = np.nanstd(a)\nmean_b = np.nanmean(b)\nstd_b = np.nanstd(b)\n\n# Calculate the p-value for the two-tailed t-test\nt_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(a, b, equal_var=False)\n\n# Print the p-value\nprint(\"p-value:\", p_value)\n```\n\nNote that we set `equal_var=False` in the `ttest_ind` function since the variances of the two samples are not assumed to be equal.\n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions."}
