{"trg_prediction": "One way to solve this problem is by using the `ttest_ind` function from the `scipy.stats` module. However, since the sizes of the samples are different, we need to account for the difference in sample sizes by using the `equal_var=False` argument in the `ttest_ind` function.\n\nAdditionally, we need to remove any NaN values from the original data arrays before performing the t-test.\n\nHere's how you can calculate the p-value for the weighted two-tailed t-test:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy.stats\n\na = np.random.randn(40)\nb = 4*np.random.randn(50)\n\n# Remove NaN values from the original data arrays\na = a[~np.isnan(a)]\nb = b[~np.isnan(b)]\n\n# Perform the two-tailed t-test\nt_stat, p_value = scipy.stats.ttest_ind(a, b, equal_var=False)\n\nprint(\"p-value:\", p_value)\n```\n\nThis will give you the p-value for the weighted two-tailed t-test."}
