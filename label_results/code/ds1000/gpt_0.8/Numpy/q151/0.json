{"trg_prediction": "One way to achieve this without using a for loop is to use boolean indexing and the `np.in1d` function.\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nA = np.array([1,1,2,3,3,3,4,5,6,7,8,8])\nB = np.array([1,2,8])\n\n# Use np.in1d to check which values in A are also in B\nmask = np.in1d(A, B)\n\n# Use the mask to filter out the values from A\nC = A[~mask]\n\nprint(C)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[3 3 3 4 5 6 7]\n```\n\nThe `np.in1d` function returns a boolean array indicating which values in `A` are also present in `B`. Then, the `~mask` is used to invert the boolean array, so that `C` contains only the values in `A` that are not in `B`."}
