{"trg_prediction": "One possible solution to convert the features to a 2D-array using sklearn and numpy is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MultiLabelBinarizer\n\nfeatures = [\n    ['f1', 'f2', 'f3'],\n    ['f2', 'f4', 'f5', 'f6'],\n    ['f1', 'f2']\n]\n\ndef solve(features):\n    mlb = MultiLabelBinarizer()\n    new_features = mlb.fit_transform(features)\n    return new_features\n\nnew_features = solve(features)\nprint(new_features)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[[1 1 1 0 0 0]\n [0 1 0 1 1 1]\n [1 1 0 0 0 0]]\n```\n\nIn this solution, we first import the necessary libraries - numpy and sklearn's MultiLabelBinarizer. Then, we define a function `solve` which takes in the list of features as an input.\n\nInside the `solve` function, we create an instance of the MultiLabelBinarizer class `mlb`. This class is used to transform the list of features into a binary matrix representation. We then call the `fit_transform` method of `mlb` to convert the features into a 2D-array `new_features`.\n\nFinally, we return the `new_features` array as the solution."}
