{"trg_prediction": "One possible solution is to use the `MultiLabelBinarizer` class from the `sklearn.preprocessing` module. This class can be used to binarize multiple labels into a one-hot encoded array.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use it to transform your list of features into a 2D array:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MultiLabelBinarizer\n\nfeatures = [\n    ['f1', 'f2', 'f3'],\n    ['f2', 'f4', 'f5', 'f6'],\n    ['f1', 'f2']\n]\n\nmlb = MultiLabelBinarizer()\nnew_features = mlb.fit_transform(features)\n```\n\nThe resulting `new_features` array will be:\n\n```\narray([[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n       [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n       [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]])\n```\n\nEach row of the array corresponds to a sample, and each column corresponds to a unique feature. The value in each cell represents whether the feature is present (1) or not (0) for that particular sample.\n\nNote that the `MultiLabelBinarizer` class expects the input features to be in a list of sets format, so you may need to preprocess your data accordingly if it is not already in this format."}
