{"trg_prediction": "One way to achieve this is to use the `MultiLabelBinarizer` class from sklearn.preprocessing. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MultiLabelBinarizer\n\n# Create an instance of MultiLabelBinarizer\nmlb = MultiLabelBinarizer()\n\n# Fit the MultiLabelBinarizer on the features\nmlb.fit(features)\n\n# Transform the features into a binary array\nnew_features = mlb.transform(features)\n\n# Convert the binary array to a DataFrame for better visualization\nnew_features = pd.DataFrame(new_features, columns=mlb.classes_)\n```\n\nThe `MultiLabelBinarizer` class is designed to handle multi-label binarization, which is exactly what we need in this case. It treats each sublist in `features` as a separate sample and each element in the sublist as a separate feature.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the `features` list contains only unique feature values. If there are duplicates within a sublist or across different sublists, the binarized array will have unexpected results. If duplicates are present, you may need to preprocess the `features` list to remove duplicates before applying the binarization."}
