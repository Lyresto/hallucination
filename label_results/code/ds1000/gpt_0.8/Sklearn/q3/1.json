{"trg_prediction": "There is no direct method in Pandas to convert a Scikit-learn Bunch object to a DataFrame. However, you can convert the data using the following steps:\n\n1. Extract the data and feature names from the Bunch object.\n2. Create a DataFrame using the extracted data and feature names.\n\nHere is an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the iris dataset\ndata = load_iris()\n\n# Extract the data and feature names\nX = data.data\nfeature_names = data.feature_names\n\n# Create a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=feature_names)\n\nprint(df.head())\n```\n\nThis will give you a DataFrame with the iris dataset's data, where each column represents a feature and each row represents an observation."}
