{"trg_prediction": "You can use the `reshape` function in numpy to convert your 2 by 2 array into a 1-dimensional array, and then apply the `MinMaxScaler` on it. Here's an example code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n\nnp_array = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n\n# Reshape the array into 1-dimensional\nflattened_array = np_array.reshape(-1)\n\n# Apply MinMaxScaler on the flattened array\nscaler = MinMaxScaler()\nnormalized_array = scaler.fit_transform(flattened_array.reshape(-1, 1))\n\n# Reshape the normalized array back to its original shape\nnormalized_array = normalized_array.reshape(np_array.shape)\n\nprint(normalized_array)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[[0.  0.5]\n [1.  1. ]]\n```\n\nIn this code, we first flatten the 2 by 2 array into a 1-dimensional array using the `reshape` function with `-1` as the argument. Then we apply the `MinMaxScaler` on the flattened array. Finally, we reshape the normalized array back to its original shape using the `reshape` function."}
