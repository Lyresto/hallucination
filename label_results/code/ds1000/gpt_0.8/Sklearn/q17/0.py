To insert or delete a step in a `Pipeline` object, you can access the `steps` attribute of the pipeline using `clf.steps`. This attribute is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the name and the estimator of a step in the pipeline.

To insert a step, you can simply append a new tuple to the `steps` list. The new tuple should contain the name and the estimator of the step you want to insert. For example, if you want to insert a `PolynomialFeatures` step after the `reduce_dim` step, you can do:

```python
clf.steps.append(('poly', PolynomialFeatures()))
```

To delete a step, you can use the `del` keyword to remove the corresponding tuple from the `steps` list. For example, if you want to delete the `reduce_dim` step, you can do:

```python
del clf.steps[0]
```

Note that modifying the `steps` attribute directly may have unexpected effects on the `Pipeline` object. It is recommended to make a copy of the pipeline before modifying it, to avoid any unwanted changes.

Here is an example code demonstrating how to insert and delete steps in a `Pipeline` object:

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

estimators = [('reduce_dim', PCA()), ('svm', SVC())]
clf = Pipeline(estimators)

# Insert a step
clf.steps.append(('poly', PolynomialFeatures()))

# Delete a step
del clf.steps[0]

print(clf.steps)
```

Output:

```
[('svm', SVC()), ('poly', PolynomialFeatures())]
```

In this example, the `reduce_dim` step is deleted and the `poly` step is inserted after the `svm` step.
