Yes, it is possible to insert or delete a step in a `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline` object. The `Pipeline` object has a `steps` attribute, which is a list of tuples containing the name and the estimator of each step in the pipeline. 

To insert a step, you can simply add a new tuple to the `steps` list at the desired position. For example, if you want to insert a step called `'new_step'` after the `'reduce_dim'` step, you can do:

``` python
new_step = ('new_step', SomeEstimator())
clf.steps.insert(1, new_step)
```

To delete a step, you can use the `del` statement to remove the tuple from the `steps` list. For example, if you want to delete the `'reduce_dim'` step, you can do:

``` python
del clf.steps[0]
```

Note that modifying the `steps` list will directly affect the `clf` object, as it is a reference to the same list. However, be careful when modifying the pipeline steps, as it may affect the behavior of the pipeline and the results of any subsequent operations.
