{"trg_prediction": "One way to solve this problem is to use the `groupby` function to group the data frame by the values in column 'b'. Then, we can apply the `mean` and `std` functions to each group to calculate the mean and standard deviation of column 'a' within each group. Finally, we can combine these results into a new data frame.\n\nHere is the solution:\n```python\nresult = df.groupby('b')['a'].agg(['mean', 'std'])\n```\nThe `groupby('b')` function groups the data frame by the unique values in column 'b'. Then, we select column 'a' with `['a']`. The `agg(['mean', 'std'])` function calculates the mean and standard deviation for each group.\n\nThe resulting data frame will have the mean and standard deviation as separate columns, with the group values as the index.\n\nOutput:\n```\n   mean        std\nb                 \n1  16.0   6.082763\n2  23.0   1.000000\n3  40.0  13.228757\n```"}
