# 1. Deleting particular days from the 'Date' column
To delete specific days from the 'Date' column, you can use the `pd.DataFrame.drop()` method. Here's how you can delete the days '2020-02-17' and '2020-02-18':

<code>
dates_to_delete = ['2020-02-17', '2020-02-18']
df = df[~df.index.date.isin(dates_to_delete)]
