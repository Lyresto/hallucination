{"trg_prediction": "One way to achieve this is by using the `zip` function along with a list comprehension. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nresult = pd.DataFrame([tuple(zip(*df_list)) for df_list in zip(a.values, b.values, c.values)], columns=a.columns)\n```\n\nThis code first uses the `zip` function to iterate over the rows of the three dataframes simultaneously. Then, using a list comprehension, it applies the `zip` function again to transpose the values of each row, resulting in tuples. Finally, it constructs a new dataframe using the list of tuples and the column names from dataframe `a`.\n\nThe resulting dataframe `result` will have the desired structure:\n\n```\n      one         two\n0  (1, 5, 9)  (2, 6, 10)\n1  (3, 7, 11) (4, 8, 12)\n```\n\nThis solution can handle an arbitrary number of dataframes, as long as they have the same number of rows and columns."}
