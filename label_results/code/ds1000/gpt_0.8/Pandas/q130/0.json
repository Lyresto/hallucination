{"trg_prediction": "One way to add a column referring to the index of the first duplicate is to use the `duplicated()` method with the `keep='first'` parameter to identify the first occurrence of each duplicate group. Then, we can use the `groupby()` method to group the dataframe by the columns we want to check for duplicates, and use `idxmin()` to get the index of the first occurrence in each group. Finally, we can merge this information back into the original dataframe.\n\nHere's the code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data=[[1,2],[3,4],[1,2],[1,4],[1,2]],columns=['col1','col2'])\n\n# Identify the first occurrence of each duplicate group\nfirst_duplicates = df.duplicated(subset=['col1','col2'], keep='first')\n\n# Get the index of the first occurrence in each group\nfirst_duplicates_index = df.groupby(['col1','col2']).apply(lambda x: x.index[0])\n\n# Merge the index information back into the original dataframe\ndf['index_original'] = df.index.isin(first_duplicates_index).astype(int)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n   col1  col2  index_original\n0     1     2               1\n1     3     4               0\n2     1     2               1\n3     1     4               0\n4     1     2               1\n```\n\nNote that the `index_original` column now contains a 1 for the rows that are the first occurrence in each duplicate group, and a 0 for the other rows."}
