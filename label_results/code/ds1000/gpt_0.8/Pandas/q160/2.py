The error occurs because the `sort()` method is not available directly on a groupby object. To achieve the desired result, you can use the `apply()` method on the groupby object and apply the `sort_values()` method to each group. Here's the solution:

```python
result = df.groupby('cokey').apply(lambda x: x.sort_values('A')).reset_index(drop=True)
```

This code groups the DataFrame `df` by the 'cokey' column and then applies the `sort_values()` method to each group based on the 'A' column. The `reset_index(drop=True)` method is used to reset the index after sorting and drop the original index column.

The resulting DataFrame `result` will have the desired sorted output:

```
      cokey   A    B
0  11168155   0   18
1  11168155  18   56
2  11168155  56   96
3  11168156   0   96
4  11168156  96  152
```

Note that the index is reset to a default numeric index. If you want to keep the 'cokey' column as the index, you can remove the `reset_index(drop=True)` part from the code.
