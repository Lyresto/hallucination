{"trg_prediction": "```python\nresult = [s.decode('utf-8') for s in x]\nreturn result\n```\n\nYou can use the `decode` function with the encoding 'utf-8' to convert each byte string in the list `x` to a string. This can be done using a list comprehension to iterate over each element in `x` and apply the `decode` function. The resulting list will contain the decoded strings."}
