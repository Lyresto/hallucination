## Problem 2
"""

"""
Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the index of the first element that satisfies the requirement.

For example, the index of (1, 4) would be 3: the elements at index 3 of x and y are 1 and 4 respectively.
A:
<code>
import numpy as np
x = np.array([0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 5, 5])
y = np.array([0, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5])
a = 1
b = 4
