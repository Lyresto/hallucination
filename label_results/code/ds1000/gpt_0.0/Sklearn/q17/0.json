{"trg_prediction": "Yes, it is possible to insert or delete a step in a sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline object. \n\nTo insert a step, you can use the insert method of the list object returned by the named_steps() method. For example, to insert a PolynomialFeatures step after the PCA step, you can do:\n\n<code>\nsteps = clf.named_steps\nsteps.insert(1, ('poly', PolynomialFeatures()))\n"}
